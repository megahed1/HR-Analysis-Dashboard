# HR Dashboard Project

This is an HR Dashboard built entirely in Excel. The project showcases my skills in data preparation, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Workflow:
1. **Data Preparation**: Data was cleaned and preprocessed using Power Query.
2. **Analysis**: Key metrics were analyzed using Pivot Tables.
3. **Visualization**: An interactive dashboard was created using Excel charts and slicers.

## Features:
- Employee count and performance trends.
- Data breakdown by department, location, and qualifications.
- Year-over-year and monthly performance analysis.

## How to Work with the Data:
If you'd like to replicate this project or perform your own analysis:
1. You'll find the dataset in a file named **HR Dataset**.
2. Use **Power Query** to **append all the tables** in the dataset into a single table for analysis.
3. Load the consolidated data into **Pivot Tables** for further exploration and analysis.
4. Finally, create your own visualizations to represent the data in an engaging manner.
